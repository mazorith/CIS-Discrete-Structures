Video: Induction 

This video I liked as I struggled slightly with Induction. I found the first part of the video a little diffcult 
to understand (around 1:12-2:00), the set of premises seemed vague to me. However when he explained it with 
the first example as ((R->W)^R) -> W it started to click. After that explaining the Laws seemed rather simple. The
exersises at the end were also every helpful to see how to use these laws to explain logical arguments, though I waited for
him to show the soultions rather than working them out myself first.
